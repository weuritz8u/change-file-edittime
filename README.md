# change-file-edittime

This is a file to change the edittime of a file.

- you need a powershell terminal installed for this! *(but on the windows it is usally installed)*

### How

- **Download the [`change_file_edittime.ps1`](change_file_edittime.ps1) file**

- *copy it in the folder with the files you need to change the edit time*

- then run the file with `Powershell` *(rightclick -> run with Powershell)*!

## Other

*LICENSE* : None

**would be cool to give credit when you copy and republish this but is not required.**

*Feel free to contribute via Issues (although Ideas) and forks / Pull Requests.*
